# React Native Tattoo Studio App

## App Overview
The Tattoo Studio App is a mobile application for booking tattoo appointments, managing rewards, calculating prices, and exploring tattoo designs. It will be built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility.

## Pages and Navigation
1. Dashboard (Home)
2. Booking
3. Custom Design
4. Rewards
5. Price Calculator
6. Cart
7. Checkout

Navigation will be handled using React Navigation, with a bottom tab navigator for main pages and stack navigators for sub-pages.

## Layout and Structure
- The app will use a consistent layout across all pages.
- A custom status bar will be implemented for a cohesive look.
- The main content area will be scrollable when necessary.
- A bottom tab navigation will be present on all main pages.

## Color Scheme
Primary colors:
- Primary Blue: #607AFB
- Secondary Blue: #4A62C8
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Text: #1F2937 (dark gray)
- Accent: #F3F4F6 (light gray)

## Typography
- Main Font: 'Inter' (or a similar sans-serif font available in React Native)
- Headings: Bold, sizes 24px, 20px, 18px
- Body Text: Regular, size 16px
- Small Text: Regular, size 14px

## Styling Approach
We'll use a combination of React Native's StyleSheet API and a custom theming solution. For more complex styling needs, we'll incorporate react-native-tailwind-css for Tailwind-like utility classes in React Native.

## UI Components and Libraries
1. React Native Elements: For basic UI components
2. React Native Vector Icons: For icon support
3. React Native Calendars: For the booking calendar
4. React Native Reanimated: For advanced animations
5. React Native Gesture Handler: For gesture-based interactions

## Custom Components
1. BottomTabBar: Custom styled bottom navigation
2. Card: Reusable card component for various content blocks
3. Button: Custom styled button with variants
4. Input: Styled text input component
5. Select: Custom dropdown/picker component
6. Avatar: User avatar component
7. ProgressBar: For displaying progress in the rewards section
8. ImageCarousel: For showcasing tattoo designs

1. Dashboard:
   - RewardsSummary
   - QuickLinks
   - LatestNews
   - GalleryPreview

2. Booking:
   - DatePicker
   - TimePicker
   - ArtistSelector

3. Custom Design:

## Animations and Interactions
- Use react-native-reanimated for smooth transitions between screens
- Implement gesture-based interactions for the image carousel and calendar
- Add subtle micro-interactions for button presses and form inputs

## Data Management
- Use React's Context API for global state management
- Implement AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- Set up API integration for backend communication

## Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for images and heavy content
- Use memo and useCallback for optimizing re-renders
- Employ virtualized lists for long scrollable content

## Accessibility
- Ensure proper labeling of all interactive elements
- Implement voice-over support for screen readers
- Use appropriate color contrasts for text readability

## Testing
- Set up Jest for unit and component testing
- Use React Native Testing Library for component integration tests
- Implement E2E testing with Detox

## Build and Deployment
- Configure the project for both iOS and Android builds
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Prepare app store assets and descriptions for submission

This structure and approach will help in creating a robust, performant, and visually appealing React Native version of the Tattoo Studio App, maintaining the core functionality and user experience of the web version while optimizing for mobile platforms.
